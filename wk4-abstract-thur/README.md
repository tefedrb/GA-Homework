## Introduction

> **Instructor Note:** This can be a pair-programming activity or done independently.

In this lab, you'll be designing an app that creates and maintains households. All households earn income and pay 20% of their income in taxes. All households also have a pet. All pets can be fed, groomed, and played with.

You can express the state or action of something by printing messages to the command line, such as "Household sells X to gain income" or "Play fetch."

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create at least one abstract class.
- Use at least one interface.
- Create at least two households, each with a different kind of pet.
- Use polymorphism to have each household earn income, pay its taxes, and care for its pet (feed, play with, and groom) in one loop.

**Bonus**: Add additional classes or subclasses.

#### Starter Code

In the starter code folder, you'll find a `Driver` class with the `main` method. This class will be where you'll implement all of your households.

#### Deliverable

A simple Java program that has at least two households. `print` statements can be used to show their behavior.
