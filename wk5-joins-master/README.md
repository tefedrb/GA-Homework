## Introduction

> This should be done independently.

In this lab, you'll write SQL scripts for PostgreSQL that will create and initialize a database with two tables (`Employee` and `Job`) and then query the data in those tables. 

The `Employee` table contains the following data:  

<p align="center">
  <img src="./screenshots/employee.png">  
</p>

The `Job` table looks like this:  

<p align="center">
  <img src="./screenshots/job.png">   
</p>

The main purpose of our scripts is to query information from both tables:  

1.  Show the full names of employees working at Macy's.
2.  Show the companies located in Boston.  
3.  Show the full name of the employee with the highest salary.  

-------

## Exercise

### Requirements

An ``init_db.sh`` script should:  
  1. Create the database. 
  1. Create the tables.
  1. Populate the tables.

A ``run_queries.sh`` script should run three queries, one for each of the following:
  1. **Employees working at Macy's**: The full names of employees working at Macy's.
  1. **Companies in Boston**: The companies located in Boston.
  1. **Employee with the highest salary**: The full name of the employee with the highest salary.

> Note: Those two files can call other files if you'd like.

### Starter Code

Refer to this lab's starter code to build your solution.

### Deliverable

A pull request with all of your code for a working app that meets the requirements above.
